# 📘 ML Data Studying Projects

A collection of prototypes, experiments, and small projects created during the ML Data Bootcamp.

This repository serves as a personal lab for testing ideas, building data-related mini-projects, and exploring tools and workflows before implementing them in the final project (ml-data-engineering-project).

It’s a place for continuous learning and hands-on experimentation.

## 🚀 Main Goals:

📊 Practice data analysis, ETL, and data pipeline concepts

⚙️ Explore tools such as SQL, PySpark, Pandas, and Jupyter

🧠 Develop and test small-scale ML and data engineering ideas

💡 Build reusable templates and snippets for future projects
